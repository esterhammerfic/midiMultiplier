# midiMultiplier
Pure Data patch: transposes incoming midi signal, allowing the user to add upper/lower octave and multiple transposed versions for midi output.

Note: Pure Data, unfortunately, doesn't interact with ASIO, so that's a pain. This was more of a first program for learning purposes. I would recommend downloading <a title="Loop Midi" href="http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html">Loop Midi</a>
 to connect to a DAW.
